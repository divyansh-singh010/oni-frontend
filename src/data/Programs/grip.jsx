    "description": "The GRIP 2023-24 initiative united 13 students across diverse academic backgrounds, immersing them in the villages of Tapovan and Urgam in Chamoli District. In collaboration with SEWA International, the program delved into socio-economic dynamics, healthcare, education, and Self-Help Groups. The hands-on exploration and cultural immersion resulted in impactful insights and documentation. GRIP 2023-24 serves as a testament to the transformative power of grassroots engagement, addressing challenges and laying the foundation for informed decision-making and positive interventions.",
